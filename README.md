# Calculating-Universe-age-using-SNe-Cosmology-Plot-with-hubble-parameter-using-Pantheon-SH0ES-dataset

This project analyzes observational data from the Pantheon+SH0ES dataset to measure fundamental cosmological parameters, specifically the Hubble constant ($H_0$) and the matter density of the universe ($\Omega_m$). By fitting Type Ia supernovae data to a cosmological model, the project provides an estimate for the age of the universe and explores the relationship between distance and redshift.
